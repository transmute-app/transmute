## What Does Transmute Replace?
*For the record, I love all of these services and use them all frequently. Transmute is not up to par with any of them yet. But it will be!*
| Service | Why Replace? |
| ------- | --------------- |
| [cloudconvert.com](https://cloudconvert.com/) |  File size limits, API is paid only, 3rd-party gets my files |
| [freeconvert.com](https://www.freeconvert.com/) | File size limits, 3rd-party gets my files |
| [cconvertio.co](https://convertio.co/) | File size limits, 3rd-party gets my files |
